<h2>About</h2>

<p>This website was created and is maintained by a <a href="https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/">Genshin Impact Wiki</a> editor. This website has limitations on how long it can be up and running every month, so in return, the website "sleeps" if no page has been viewed for a while and then takes a few extra seconds to wake up when someone visits the website again.</p>

<p>I created this website half because I believe hiliologists need it and half because I wanted to learn something new (namely, how to deploy a website using Heroku).</p>

<p>To send feedback about this database website, please join <a href="https://discord.com/invite/CVKTBANp">the Genshin Impact Wiki's Discord server</a> and send a message in the <i>#genshin-languages</i> channel, which is viewable upon self-assigning the Lore role.</p>

<p>Unordered to-do list:</p>
<ul>
	<li>padding/margins (see front page)</li>
	<li>filter by word
		<ul>
			<li>filter by exact word (e.g. to avoid picking up all instances of <i>mita</i> when looking for just <i>mi</i>)</li>
			<li>filter not by exact word (e.g. to pick up all instances of <i>mimi</i> when looking for <i>mi</i> if so desired)</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li>filter by speaker
		<ul>
			<li>may want to filter by type of speaker (e.g. native speaker vs student)
				<ul>
					<li>may want to search for Jacob Musk and Ella Musk at the same time (both are dedicated Hilichurlian scholars)</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>maybe we should distinguish between Hilichurls? e.g. happy ones, unhappy ones; this might be better as a new field</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li>filter by source</li>
	<li>don't think these would be of much help, but may as well also filter by translation sources and words in translations</li>
	<li>pagination with "show all" option</li>
	<li>option to view context in a bigger box</li>
	<li>maybe if the screen is narrow, then the rows and columns swap? not sure if that's a good idea, but my thinking is that all the data for a normal row can fit on a narrow screen if the row is a column instead, and horizontal scrolling will mean looking at what would normally be new rows instead</li>
	<li>new field "version" to show which utterances have been available since which versions of the game?</li>
</ul>
