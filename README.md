# hilichurlian_database_project
A quick and dirty database website for a conlang in a game my friends play (the Hilichurlian language in the game Genshin Impact).

Yet another app done in Django. I wanted to get this up and running fast, so I chose something I'm familiar with. I'm new to PostgreSQL, though.
